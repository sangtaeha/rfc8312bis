      "body": "As discussed in [this tcpm thread](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tcpm/O7Q55oXcoI1XNBZ_wAQOMdhRQNY/), after fast convergence (section 4.6), the candidate target value of the congestion window may be less than the current congestion window. For example, say cwnd = 100, beta_cubic = .7 and a congestion event occurs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nW_max = cwnd = 100;\r\nW_max = W_max*(1.0+beta_cubic)/2.0 = 85   // further reduce W_max for fast convergence\r\n\r\ncwnd = cwnd * beta_cubic = 70\t          // window reduction\r\nW_cubic(0) = W_max * beta_cubic = 59.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we were to enter congestion avoidance at this point, with a small enough RTT, the candidate target congestion window as calculated by W_cubic(t+RTT) may be less than the current congestion window (~59.5 < 70). \r\n\r\nThe suggestion in the thread from Lisong Xu and Vidhi Goel is to change Equation 2 to:\r\n```\r\nK = cubic_root((W_max - cwnd)/C) (Eq. 2)\r\n```\r\nwhere cwnd is the congestion window size at the beginning of the current congestion avoidance. This will ensure the target is greater than the current congestion window, and in my opinion is a more clear representation of what K represents.",

RFC assumes that cwnd is set to W_max * beta_cubic in fast recovery and remains as W_max * beta_cubic at the beginning of a congestion avoidance stage. However, the behavior of Linux TCP in/around fast recovery is complicated, such as adjusting cwnd based on the number of packets in flight, and adjusting cwnd in case of undo. As a result, at the beginning of a congestion avoidance stage, cwnd may or may not be W_max * beta_cubic, and sometimes may be even higher than W_max. \r\n\r\nI guess this RFC does not need to follow the fast recovery of Linux TCP, but it is safer to add that else condition. \r\n\r\nThanks",

However, this targe size may be too high, like even higher than 2 * cwnd (i.e., more aggressive than slow start), in the following special cases.\r\n\r\n   * case 1: RTT is extremely long. An extremely long RTT is very likely an indication of network congestion, in such an environment it is dangerous to set a very high target. \r\n\r\n  * case 2: after a long idle period (i.e., a big increase of t). This is a [bug reported and fixed by Google](http://bitsup.blogspot.com/2015/09/).\r\n\r\n  * case 3: after a long application rate-limited period (i.e., a bug increase of t). Similar to case 2\r\n\r\nTo be safer, we may change Equation (1) as follow to fix all the above bugs\r\n\r\n```\r\n    W_cubic(t) = C*(t-K)^3 + origin_point (Eq. 1)\r\n    if (W_cubic (t) > 2* cwnd)\r\n        W_cubic(t)  =  2 * cwnd\r\n```\r\nNote that, Linux Cubic already does something similar ([line 328](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c#L328)) by limiting target to be no more then 1.5 * cwnd.\r\n\r\nThanks",

Consequentially the slope (inverse of\n    ca->cnt) would be really large, and eventually ca->cnt would be\n    lower-bounded in the end to 2 to have delayed-ACK slow-start behavior.\n\n    This particularly shows up when slow_start_after_idle is disabled\n    as a dangerous cwnd inflation (1.5 x RTT) after few seconds of idle\n    time.\n\n    Jana initial fix was to reset epoch_start if app limited,\n    but Neal pointed out it would ask the CUBIC algorithm to recalculate the\n    curve so that we again start growing steeply upward from where cwnd is\n    now (as CUBIC does just after a loss). Ideally we'd want the cwnd growth\n    curve to be the same shape, just shifted later in time by the amount of\n    the idle period.\n\n    Reported-by: Jana Iyengar <jri@google.com>\n    Signed-off-by: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>\n    Signed-off-by: Yuchung Cheng <ycheng@google.com>\n    Signed-off-by: Neal Cardwell <ncardwell@google.com>\n    Cc: Stephen Hemminger <stephen@networkplumber.org>\n    Cc: Sangtae Ha <sangtae.ha@gmail.com>\n    Cc: Lawrence Brakmo <lawrence@brakmo.org>\n    Signed-off-by: David S.

Is that the intent?\r\n\r\nThe Linux TCP CUBIC implementation has already always bounded the rate of increase of the cwnd to at most 1.5x per round trip time. Initially it did this implicitly (the logic only allowed cwnd increases on at most every alternate ACK), and then when the stretch ACKs fixes were put in place the bound became explicit. See:\r\n  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c?id=d578e18ce93f5d33a7120fd57c453e22a4c0fc37\r\n\r\nGiven that separate pre-existing bound of 1.5x per round trip, AFAICT the proposed fix of bounding to less than 2x per round trip would be NOP, AFAICT? Or perhaps I misunderstand the proposal.\r\n\r\nBy the way, for YouTube we found this implicit bound of 1.5x per round trip was important for keeping losses at a reasonable level. This has a large impact on behavior, and presumably big implications for fairness between CUBIC implementations. So this may be important to document in the RFC, if it is not already (I couldn't find it, but I may have just missed it).\r\n",

IOW Cubic is often\r\n\"Reno\" unless the loss rate is abysmal. The modelled approach is based\r\non a simple bulk transfer where modern network applications are mostly\r\nstructured traffic (burst, idle, repeat). Under such traffic\r\nstructures the model has two issues:\r\n>\r\n>The model assumes cwnd overshoot causes losses that are repaired in\r\none round of fast recovery. In reality, the losses are often due to\r\nbursts to short messages, causing more rounds and even timeouts to\r\nrepair. So the overall loss rate \"p\" tends to be higher than the ideal\r\nmodel, causing the model to underestimate the window (hence runs in a\r\nmore conservative Reno). Instead Linux's approach is to simply emulate\r\nReno AIMD based on the number of packets per ACK. This also avoids\r\nsquare-root operation.",

There were three points:\r\n\r\n1) Issues with the formula base \"Reno compatibility\", which is documented in issue #20 \r\n2) Sensitivity of Hystart to delay jitter, which is more an issue with Hystart than with Cubic\r\n3) Sensitivity to spurious repeats\r\n\r\nI think that third issue should be addressed in the revised RFC. The basic problem is that any detected packet loss causes the host to reduce the window and start a new epoch. In some environments we can see spurious loss detection, caused for example by delayed ACKs or out of order delivery. These spurious losses can be easily identified in QUIC, and with some extra work in TCP. It would be useful if the revised RFC has a section on handling spurious losses.\r\n\r\nThe handling that I did implement was simple: reset the epoch parameters to the value of the previous epoch, before the loss. Documenting at least that would be nice.\r\n\r\n",
